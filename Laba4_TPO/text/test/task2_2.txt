Of  course,  a  nation  become  dishonored  and  characterless
will  not  care  about  that  sort  of  teaching.  For  whoever
cherishes  it  can  certainly  not  sink  so  low,  but  he  alone
collapses  who  forgets  or  no  longer  wants  to  know  it.  So
one  must  not  expect  embodiments  of  characterless  sub-
mission suddenly  to  repent  in  order,  on  the  basis  of  intelli-
gence and  all  human  experience,  to  act  otherwise  than
hitherto.  On  the  contrary,  these  very  people  will  hold
every  such  lesson  at  a  distance,  until  the  nation  is  either
once  and  for  all  accustomed  to  its  slave's  yoke,  or  until


Belief  in  the  possibility  of  international  conciliation  is  taken
to  be  a  sign  of  deterioration.  Pidder  Lting  writes:  'Every
effort  made  towards  cementing  international  ties,  or  bringing
about  international  understanding  and  unification  always
takes  its  rise  in  individuals  whose  feelings  are  degenerate  and
rootless  in  a  folkish  sense,  regardless  of  whether  their  motives
are  idealistic  or  economic.  There  is  no  international  solidarity
among  plants,  and  there  is  none  among  animals.  There  is  also
none  among  men  who  found  their  notions  on  the  laws  of  nature.
The  idea  of  "humanity "  is  an  abstraction  which  cannot  be
translated  into  practical  life.'  Cf.  Nationals ozialismus.
